## RAG vs AutoAI RAG

### RAG
RAG enhances large language models (LLMs) by enabling them to retrieve relevant information from external data sources before generating a response.
- To improve the accuracy and reliability of LLM responses by grounding them in factual data.
- To enable LLMs to access and utilize up-to-date information beyond their training data.

This process involves:
- Retrieving relevant documents or data based on a user's query.
- Providing that retrieved information to the LLM.
- The LLM then uses this information to generate a more accurate and contextually appropriate answer.

### AutoAI RAG
AutoAI RAG automates the process of optimizing RAG pipelines. It is an automation layer built on top of RAG with focuse on optimizing the RAG process itself.
- It uses automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques to find the best configuration for a RAG system based on specific data and use cases.
- It also provides a streamlined process for deploying optimized RAG solutions.

This process involves:
- To simplify and accelerate the development and deployment of effective RAG systems.
- To improve the performance of RAG applications by automatically finding the best configurations.
- To reduce the amount of expert knowledge needed to create effective RAG pipelines.
